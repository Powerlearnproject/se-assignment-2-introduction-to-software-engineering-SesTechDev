Software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.It encompasses a set of methods, tools, and processes aimed at creating reliable, efficient, and maintainable software products. Software engineering involves various disciplines, including computer science, project management, and quality assurance, to ensure that software meets the needs of users, is delivered on time and within budget, and adheres to high-quality standards
Software engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies engineering principles to the development of software systems.
Waterfall Model:

Sequential approach: Each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Emphasizes extensive planning and documentation upfront.
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable scope.
Limited flexibility for accommodating changes during development.
High risk of late-stage surprises and rework if requirements change.
Agile Model:

Iterative and incremental approach: Development is done in short iterations or sprints.
Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Suitable for projects with evolving or unclear requirements.
Allows for frequent feedback and adaptation, reducing the risk of late-stage changes.
Requires active involvement of stakeholders throughout the development process.
